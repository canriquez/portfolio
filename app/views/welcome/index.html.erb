        <p class="mobile pc">Technology, Electronics, and the beauty of simple engineering solutions is my passion.</p>
        <p class="pc"> It all started when I was 9 years old, learning to code on a CZ spectrum. Later electronics and radio took my heart so much that electronic engineering was my BA of choice.</p>
        <p class="pc">I got more interested in the computer and radio electronics. Years later, after more experimenting and a couple of endeavors involving building radio transmitters at 15 years old, I graduated as an electronic engineer who wanted to invent stuff. </p>
        <p class="pc">Life brought change and excellent opportunities in the telecom industry. I managed small projects, big projects, and later great teams.</p>
        <p class="mobile"> Telecoms brought me to work with great people across 13 countries and the chance to live in big cities like Buenos Aires, London, and Munich.</p>
        <p class="mobile pc">After 17 years in telecom, I have now started my adventure in the software development industry, and I am loving it. </p>
